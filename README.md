# 👋 &nbsp;Hi

I'm Dan, a software engineer in the UK.

## 🏭 &nbsp;Day job.

I'm currently a senior developer at [CoverageBook](https://coveragebook.com/), a public relations reporting tool.

## 🤡 &nbsp;Side projects.

I'm usually starting side projects and not finishing them, but these ones I've stuck with for a while.

### A PDF to Image API

A simple RESTful API that will accept the URL of a PDF, and then convert all or some pages to PNG.

### Green Hill Zone

Attempt to recreate (partially) the first zone of Sonic using [DragonRuby](https://dragonruby.org/).
